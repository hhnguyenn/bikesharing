# NYC to Des Moines Citi Bike Analysis
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

##Objective
This presentation will focus on predicting the success of bikesharing in Des Moises, Iowa based on CitiBike data from New York, New York.  A comparison of population, weather, and location of McDonalds restaurants will be examined. 

##Dashboard 1
Here we examined average trip duration based on age or year of birth of the client.  There's also a breakdown of gender based on number of records that we have.  There is also a map of starting locations of bike rides in New York city.

##Dashboard 2
The next slide showed the location of various McDonalds in New York City and Des Moines as it is a popular restaurant for bikers and everyone alike.  We also compare the population of both cities.

###Dashboard 3
An examination of Des Moines weather is listed here.  We can see that Des Moines is perfect of biking whether it's for business or for leisure.
